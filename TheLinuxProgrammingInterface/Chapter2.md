### Fundamental Concepts

#### The Core Operating System: The Kernel

The term operating system is commonly used with two different meanings:

* To denote the entire package consisting of the central software managing a computerâ€™s resources and all of the accompanying standard software tools, such as command-line interpreters, graphical user interfaces, file utilities, and editors.
* More narrowly, to refer to the central software that manages and allocates computer resources (i.e., the CPU, RAM, and devices).

##### Tasks performed by the kernel

the kernel performs the following tasks:

* Process scheduling
* Memory management
* Provision of a file system
* Creation and ternimation of processes
* Acess to devices
* Networking
* Provision of a system call application programming interface

##### Kernel mode and user mode

Modern processor architectures typically allow the CPU to operate in at least two different modes: user mode and kernel mode (sometimes also referred to as supervisor mode). Hardware instructions allow switching from one mode to the other. Correspondingly, areas of virtual memory can be marked as being part of user space or kernel space.

##### Process versus kernel views of the system

In many everyday programming tasks, we are accustomed to thinking about programming in a process-oriented way.

By contrast, a running system has one kernel that knows and controls everything. The kernel facilitates the running of all processes on the system. The kernel decides which process will next obtain access to the CPU, when it will do so, and for how long. The kernel maintains data structures containing information about all running processes and updates these structures as processes are created, change state, and terminate. The kernel maintains all of the low-level data structures that enable the filenames used by programs to be translated into physical locations on the disk. The kernel also maintains data structures that map the virtual memory of each process into the physical memory of the computer and the swap area(s) on disk. All communication between processes is done via mechanisms provided by the kernel. In response to requests from processes, the kernel creates new processes and terminates existing processes. Lastly, the kernel (in particular, device drivers) performs all direct communication with input and output devices, transferring information to and from user processes as required.
